# Priority Queue

An priority queue is a non-linear data structure which stores data items along with an associated priority, and allows efficient access to the highest priority item.

# In Memory

In memory, an array looks like this:

# Operations

An array supports the following operations:

* **insert**: obtain a value stored in the structure at a specific indexed position in the array.
  * O(1), constant time. An array variable really just records the base address of the array, so we know the exact memory address of the beginning of the array. We also know the data type of the elements in the array, and therefore the size of each element. Given the index of an element we wish to read, we can calculate the address of that element in *one step*: base address + sizeof(datatype) * index. Since we can calculate this in one step for all values in the array, this is an O(1) constant time operation.
* **pop**: obtain a value stored in the structure at a specific indexed position in the array.

# Use Cases

An array is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why].

# Example

```
p = PriorityQueue()
p.insert(7)           # add the value 7 to the queue
p.popMin()            # remove and return the highest priority value
p.peek()              # return the highest priority value, leaving value in the queue
```
