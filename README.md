# My Data Structures Handbook

by STEVE FINCH

This is a summary of the data structures I have mastered. A data structure is a description of a data storage
container which provides both a description of the data and of the operations allowed when using the data. The
user of the data structure should not need to be concerned with the actual implementation.
They only need to be concerned with the operations provided by the data structure and the effienciecy of those
operations relative to other data structures.

Different data structures are more efficient at different operations.  Often, a particular problem is more easily
solved or runs more efficiently when it uses an appropriate data structure. For example, a problem needing efficient
access to any individual item of data should not use a data structure that only provides efficient access to the first
item of data.


 
## The List

* [Stack](stack.md)
* [Queue](queue.md)
* [Deque](deque.md)
* [Array](array.md)
* [Tuple](tuple.md)
* [Linked List](linked_list.md)
* [Tree](tree.md)
* [Binary Heap](heap.md)
* [Priority Queue](priority_queue.md)
* [Hash Table](hash_table.md)
* [Graph](graph.md)
